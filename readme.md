*   division - **"/"**
*   multiplication - **"\*"**

#### ADVANCED FEATURES:

*   exponentiation - **"^"**
*   taking the root of a number - **"âˆš"**
*   calculating a value from a number **"cos()"**, **"sin()"** and **"tan()"**
*   calculating a value from a number **"acos()"**, **"asin()"** and **"atan()"**
*   calculating a value from a number **"log()"** and **"ln()"**

#### HOW TO USE:

1.  All buttons on the screen are active
2.  To calculate the expression, you need to click on the button **"="**
3.  To drawe plot, you need to click on the button **"x"** and **"="**
4.  In the graph window, you can change the scale by clicking on the **"+"** or **"-"** buttons.
5.  The error is always **"0"**

#### RECOMENDATION:

1.  Don't enter invalid values. Exmple: cos()
2.  Don't plot on a huge scale

4.  The error is always **"ERROR"**

#### RECOMENDATION:

*   Don't enter invalid values. Exmple: term: -1221312
*   maximum value of years = 55
*   maximum value of total credit amount = 1E9

### MENU

#### HOW TO USE:
